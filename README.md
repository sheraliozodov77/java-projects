# Multi-Project Repository

This repository contains several Java class projects with user-friendly interfaces. If you're interested in using any of these projects, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

In each project's folder, you will find an accompanying PDF file that extensively covers the project's details.

## ConnectFour

Connect Four is a two-player board game in which players take turns dropping tokens into a vertical grid of six rows and seven columns. The tokens fall straight down to occupy the lowest available space in the column. The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of their tokens wins the game. If the board fills up before either player achieves this, then the game is a draw.

## CheapHouses

This project offers a Java program that visualizes the distribution of affordable housing within a county. It reads data from a CSV file containing house addresses, prices, and coordinates, storing them in a data structure. The program identifies houses priced under a specified threshold (e.g., less than $125,000) and plots them as small filled circles on a user-friendly graphical interface. Users can specify the CSV file and cutoff price for visualization, with "houses.csv" as the default filename.

## GenericMap

A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values by using a hash function to ‘hash’ the
key into an index for an array. It supports constant time ‘puts’ and ‘gets’ and so it is a common
way to implement ADTs such as maps/dictionaries and sets. This project involves the
implementation of a generic map using a hash table.

## PriorityQueue

The project's objective is to implement a priority queue using a binary minimum heap, focusing on non-generic structures and practicing good coding practices. In this context, the priority queue is tailored for Patient objects, reflecting their urgency based on assigned integer priority ratings. Urgency is determined by smaller integers, with a priority of 1 signifying the highest urgency. The PatientQueue class is responsible for managing patient priorities, ensuring that the most urgent patients are seen first, regardless of their order of arrival. This implementation effectively transforms the typical first-in, first-out (FIFO) queue into a priority queue, optimizing patient care in a hospital setting.
